# A survey of audio classification methods with a practical example

This repository summarizes audio processing methods in an Excel sheet, primarily focusing on audio classification. It contains traditional methods, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and variations, including supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised methods. 

It includes multiple domains, such as environmental sound classification, keyword spotting, animal sound detection, genre recognition, and lung sound classification. Each model includes a short description of its workflow, and you can filter by various categories, such as preprocessing methods, and neural network types.

### Practical example

In the folder `pig_detection_clap`, a practical example can be found using a real-world dataset where short segments of audio are classified using the zero-shot model called `CLAP` by Microsoft. 

The description of that method can be found in the `README.md` of that folder.
